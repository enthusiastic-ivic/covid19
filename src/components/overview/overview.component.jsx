      COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) is an illness caused by a novel
      coronavirus now called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
      (SARS-CoV-2; formerly called 2019-nCoV), which was first identified amid
      an outbreak of respiratory illness cases in Wuhan City, Hubei Province,
      China. It was initially reported to the WHO on December 31, 2019. On
      January 30, 2020, the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global health
      emergency.On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic,
      its first such designation since declaring H1N1 influenza a pandemic in
      2009.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to
      moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special
      treatment. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like
      cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer
      are more likely to develop serious illness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed
      about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads.
      Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using
      an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or
      discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so itâ€™s
      important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by
      coughing into a flexed elbow).
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19.
      However, there are many ongoing clinical trials evaluating potential
      treatments. WHO will continue to provide updated information as soon as
      clinical findings become available.
